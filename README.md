### Notes

A challenge I faced while working on the app was when my app kept crashing after building. I figured out that the issue was that I had changed the wrong RelativeLayout id. Another challenging part was getting the backgrounds to overlay each other and getting the rounded corners to match with the current design of the app, both of which I ended up scrapping since I thought that a gradient may be nicer and having rounded corners when everything else is sharp didn't seem visually appealing.

### Notes
A challenge that I had while working on this app was figuring out why the movies would not show up on the screen. I found that the issue was that I was returning 0 in getting the item count rather than the total number of movies in the list.
